-Author: Harry Turner   
-Board: Stm32F401RE  
-Language: C++  
-Framework: MBED  
-Version: MBED OS V6.15  
-Year Created: 2022  

### Code Use Instructions
------------------
This code is designed to be ran inside of MBED Studio as certain files like mbed_app.json are needed to be run to allow functionality for things like 'printf'.  
For this code to be run it either needs to be used inside an existing program on your system **OR** when loaded, navigate to the libraries section and link 'mbed-os' to your local installation of the Mbed OS.  
On first run, it will take a while to run as it needs to also create the 'BUILD' file, which is made when you first run the program with your board.
